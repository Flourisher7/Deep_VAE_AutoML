# Genetic Algorithm Optimization for VAE Hyperparameters and Neural Architecture
## Introduction
This repository contains code for optimizing the architecture, hyperparameters, and latent space size of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using a Genetic Algorithm. The optimized parameters are then used to train the VAE model and impute missing values in data.
## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries and dependencies installed:

* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Pandas
* NumPy
* DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)
You can install these libraries using `pip`:
```
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy deap
```
## Usage
### 1. Genetic Algorithm Optimization

Run the genetic-algorithms.py script to optimize the neural architecture, hyperparameters, and latent space size of the VAE. The genetic algorithm will evolve a population of candidate solutions to find the best configuration. To execute the script, use the following command:

```
python genetic-algorithms.py
```
The optimized parameters will be stored in the Hall of Fame (HOF) after the optimization process.
### 2. Training the VAE with Optimized Parameters

After obtaining the optimized parameters from the genetic algorithm, you can use them to train the VAE model. Implement the VAE model using TensorFlow and Keras. You can access the optimized parameters from the Hall of Fame (HOF) and use them in your VAE implementation.

### 3. Impute Missing Values

Once the VAE is trained, you can use it to impute missing values in your dataset. The VAE will learn a latent representation of the data and generate plausible imputed values for the missing entries.

### 4 Additional Considerations

* It's recommended to store the optimized parameters in a separate configuration file or data structure for easy access during VAE training.
* Make sure to customize your VAE model to use the hyperparameters and architecture specified in the optimized parameters.
